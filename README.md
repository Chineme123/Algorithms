Visualizing 25 Algorithms

Welcome to the Algorithm Visualization Project! This project aims to provide a visual representation of 25 different algorithms, including popular ones like linear search, binary search, bubble sort, radix sort, and many more. The visualization is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help you better understand how these algorithms work step by step.

## Introduction

Understanding algorithms can be challenging, especially for beginners. Visualizing algorithms can greatly assist in comprehending their inner workings. This project provides a web-based platform to visualize 25 different algorithms, making it easier for learners to grasp their concepts and mechanics.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that provides the user interface for selecting and visualizing algorithms.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file responsible for styling the user interface.
- **scripts**: This directory contains JavaScript files for each algorithm visualization.
- **images**: Any images or icons used in the project can be found here.
- **README.md**: The documentation you're currently reading.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd Algorithms
   ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

4. Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.

5. Click the "Visualize" button to see the algorithm in action. You can step through the algorithm's execution to understand each step.

6. Enjoy exploring and learning about different algorithms!
